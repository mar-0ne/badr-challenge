# badr-challenge
### A friend of mine wrote a challenge for me. I'm solving it here :)

1 **first step**</br> He asked me to generate a pair of GPG keys and send the public key to him.</br></br>
`$ gpg --full-generate-key`</br></br>
2 **second step**</br> He sent to me an Image: ![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](black.hole "black hole")</br>
Well, that image was containing a text inside of it, he wrote int the instructions that I should get that text:</br></br>
`$ cat black.hole`</br>
The text is: *Follow the txt in the* [marone.pythops.com](https://marone.pythops.com) </br>
if you go to that URL in the browser it's not going to work! that's the trick cause he meant by *follow the txt* to check the value of the TXT DNS record !!!
